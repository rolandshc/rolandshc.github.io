The environmental reflection of this kit is just too perfect. The image tracking is also very fast.

Unlike the ARKit, the maximum moving number of images for active tracking could be up to 20. However, the tracking quality is comparatively poorly in general. And the performance vary a lot on different devices with different hardware specifications and Android OS versions.
